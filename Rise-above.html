    <h1>Rise Above: Turning Pain into Purpose</h1>

    <p>Life is not a straight road. It’s full of bends, potholes, and detours. But it is within those challenging curves that greatness is born. Every pain, every setback, and every delay holds a seed of purpose—if only we dare to rise above.</p>

    <h2>💥 1. Your Story Isn’t Over Yet</h2>
    <p>Too many people stop halfway because of failure. But failure is not final. The people who win in life are not those who never fall—they are those who never stay down.</p>
    <p><em>“Do not judge me by my success. Judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.”</em> – Nelson Mandela</p>
    <p>Every day you wake up, you have another chance to rise. Your past doesn't define you; your decision to keep going does.</p>

    <h2>💡 2. Turn Wounds Into Wisdom</h2>
    <p>You have been through pain. Maybe heartbreak, rejection, betrayal, or poverty. But what if your pain wasn’t meant to destroy you—but to shape you?</p>
    <p><strong>The wound is where the light enters you.</strong> Let your suffering become your strength. Let your mess become your message. You were not broken to stay broken. You were broken to become unbreakable.</p>

    <h2>⏳ 3. Stop Waiting—Start Creating</h2>
    <p>Many people wait for the “right moment.” But the right moment is <strong>now</strong>. You don’t need perfect conditions to take the first step.</p>
    <p>Greatness is not born in comfort zones. It is born when you take action <em>even when afraid</em>.</p>

    <h2>🔥 4. Your Dreams Are Valid</h2>
    <p>Don’t let anyone make you feel small. Your dreams are valid, even if no one believes in them. You are not too old. You are not too young. You are not too poor. You are not too late.</p>
    <p>Believe in your vision—even when it's invisible to others. Walk like your dreams are possible, and soon, others will start to believe it too.</p>

    <h2>🧱 5. Build Daily. Win Eventually.</h2>
    <p>Success is not overnight. It is built <strong>brick by brick</strong>. Don’t despise the small beginnings. Stay consistent.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One page a day becomes a book.</li>
      <li>One workout a day becomes a transformation.</li>
      <li>One prayer a day becomes spiritual fire.</li>
      <li>One investment a day becomes financial freedom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep building. The result will come.</p>

    <h2>🎯 6. Your Life Is Bigger Than You</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we go through battles not just for ourselves, but for those who are watching us. Your survival could be someone else’s hope.</p>
    <p>When you rise, you give others permission to rise too. So stand strong—not just for you, but for those who will one day say: <em>“Because of you, I didn’t give up.”</em></p>

    <div class="final">
      <p>In a world full of darkness, choose to shine. In a time full of fear, choose to be brave. In a generation full of excuses, choose to take responsibility.</p>
      <p>You are more powerful than your pain. More gifted than your past. And more important than you think.</p>
      <p>💪 Rise above. Turn your pain into purpose. And let your life become a light to the world.</p>
